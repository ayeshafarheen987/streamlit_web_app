st.write("""Although football is the most popular sport worldwide, it is also a major industry. Numerous clubs generate significant revenue by nurturing young players and then selling them to larger clubs for substantial sums of money. The transfer of players has a significant influence on a club's potential success, with market values playing a crucial role in transfer negotiations. Our aim is to examine the data and pinpoint the key factors that impact the determination of a player's market value. Subsequently, we construct a model to forecast a player's market value, providing club managers with a valuable tool for negotiation.
